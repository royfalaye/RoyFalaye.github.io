## Basketball
I began my basketball journey in 2022 during my first year of university (100 level). Initially, I struggled to master the game, but through consistent practice and dedication, I gradually improved my skills. With each game, I learned and grew, refining my techniques and strategies. While I primarily participate in inter-school competitions, basketball remains an integral part of my life.

Unfortunately, in 2023, a hand injury sustained during practice required immediate medical attention. I underwent surgery and subsequently embarked on a rehabilitation program that lasted for several weeks. After a period of recovery, I was thrilled to return to the court and continue pursuing my passion for the sport.

## Violin and Drum 

My musical journey began in year 7 at Chrisland High School in Abuja, where I embarked on learning the violin. To the best of my recollection, I was the sole student who performed solo pieces during school events. However, my musical pursuits were temporarily interrupted when I transitioned to a new school that lacked an orchestra program. Furthermore, my violin sustained damage, further hindering my ability to continue playing.

Fortunately, in 2023, my father's support rekindled my passion for music. He arranged for me to receive instruction from a qualified music teacher. I am delighted to report that I have resumed playing the violin and continue to enjoy the enriching experience.
